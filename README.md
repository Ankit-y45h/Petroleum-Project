ðŸ“‚ Overview

The Petroleum Project contains two scientific/computational modules written in Python:

Finding GIIP and OIIP â€” calculation of gas in place (GIIP) and oil initially in place (OIIP) for petroleum reservoirs.

External Pressure in Radial Flow of Incompressible Fluids â€” models/extracts the external pressure behavior in radial flow scenarios of incompressible fluids.

The project is intended as a reference / educational demonstration of reservoir engineering / petroleum engineering computational methods.

âš™ Requirements / Technologies

Language: Python

Required packages: (you may list them here, e.g. numpy, scipy, matplotlib etc.)

Python version: (if relevant, e.g. 3.8+)

âœ¨ Features

Calculation of volumetric estimates for gas and oil in place.

Modelling of external pressure in a radial flow for incompressible fluids, useful in reservoir engineering contexts.

Possibly includes analytical solutions, numerical integration or simulation.

ðŸ”­ Potential Extensions / Future Work

Add more robust input validation (e.g. verifying units, ranges)

Expand to compressible fluid or multiphase flow models

Provide visualization / plotting of intermediate profiles or results

Create a web interface or GUI for entering reservoir parameters

Automate comparisons with field data
